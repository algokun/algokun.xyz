### Me in 30 Seconds
Hi there, I am Mohan. You may know me as [algokun](https://www.twitter.com/algokun). I'm a design minded developer and a product nerd â€” who believes **empathy** can be used to solve most of the user problems in the world.

I like to see how my ideas ðŸ’­ could be converted to products ðŸ“º

I've been coding since 16 and have experience with various web and mobile technologies such as Node.js, React, Flutter.

### Website
You just landed on my planet in this huge galaxy of internet and in this planet you may encounter species

- centaur â€” half-baked notes
- unicorns â€” high-value stuff
- pegasus â€” personal projects

I created this planet to help me write, share and connect with other worlds. I made this website using my own static site generator which is in it's baby stage and I'm working to improve its functionality.

### Goal

- Further Exploration in design and development
- Getting control over my thoughts and achieve inner peace
- Build products that users really need and help them solve their problems.
