### Me in 30 Seconds
Hi there, I am Mohan. You may know me as [algokun](https://www.twitter.com/algokun). I'm a design minded developer and a product nerd — who believes **empathy** can be used to solve most of the user problems in the world.

I like to see how my ideas 💭 could be converted to products 📺

I've been coding since 16 and have experience with various web and mobile technologies such as Node.js, React, Flutter.

### Website
You just landed on my planet in this huge galaxy of internet and in this planet you may encounter species

- centaur — half-baked notes
- unicorns — high-value stuff
- pegasus — personal projects

I created this planet to help me write, share and connect with other planets in this huge galaxy of internet.

Coming to the development side of this planet, I pledge to keep things minimal and simple right from the start and that's reason I decided to ditch everything and chose [Mizi](), a static site generator built with C++.
### Goal

- Further Exploration in design and development
- Getting control over my thoughts and achieve inner peace
- Build products that users really need and help them solve their problems.
## Journal
