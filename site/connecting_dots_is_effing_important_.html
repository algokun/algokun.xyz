Like literally lot and thinks himself that he can understand anything and he's the best one - who could possibly be the next zuck (just kidding)</p><p>When he read something, he just assumes he understood it and never questioned his guts. He literally consuming a hell lot of information and his expectations are reaching mars.</p><p>Lately he realized that he was unable to explain something to his friends and he's sad.</p><p>Ever happened something like this? Let's see where he failed and how he failed.</p><p>I would like to quote a statement from Richard Feynman "You don't fool yourself and you're the easy person to being fool". Reading something doesn't mean you understand it. The only way to ensure is by explaining it to someone or writing it down.</p><p>When reading you're just importing the raw information from the writer's words and they just stored as raw nodes. They can't be reused in the future, unless you try to keep on remembering them.</p><p>You have to keep questioning yourself whether you understand it or not. When you understand you'll be able to connect the existing dots you have.</p><p>Don't just read for information, read for understanding. Yeah there's a possibility that sometimes information can help you understand something, when it does question yourself.</p><p>Thanks for coming this far by reading everything. I'm trying to write my raw thoughts about a topic and this is the first one.</p><p></p><hr/></main><footer><p><p>Website generated using <u><a href='https://github.com/abstractxan/Mizi'>abstractxan/Mizi</a><u></p></p></footer></body></html>
