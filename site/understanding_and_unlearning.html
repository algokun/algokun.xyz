It's might be of two reasons - you memorise it or you just consumed a part of the spectrum </p><p>If you memorise something, it is because you assumed you understood something and the gaps are left unfilled. To test your understanding, you can either teach someone (it could be you) or write it down or attack it from multiple things</p><p>Feynman beautifully puts **You don't fool yourself and you're the easiest one to fool**</p><p>The ability to rethink and unlearn matters most. As, you're just biased towards your existing knowledge and you can't foresee what you know. **The greatest enemy of learning is what you think you know**</p><p>To understand the whole spectrum, you need to unlearn and gain new lens to see your past knowledge.</p><p>Thanks for coming this far by reading everything.
